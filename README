= Mailman WebID initial ideas:

== Basic features:
=== Web interface
 1. subscription through WebID (disable majordomo-style commands?)
 2. web interface authentication with WebID (view subscribers list, view archive in case of private)
 
 
=== Semantic formats
 3. generate archives with RDFa (SIOC) + link to pure RDF
 4. generate FOAF group with the subscribers lists
 5. generate FOAF profile with each subscriber (with knows? for the people he/she answered mail and the list of SIOC posts he/she generated)
 
=== mail content
 6. header in mail that include the URI to the archive (Archived-At header: --> see w3c lists). Maybe also in the same mail as text
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5064
    
 7. embed attachments (ie, see pictures in the webpage)
 
=== Protocol

 7. send receive mail through http PUT authenticating with WebID (to receive the mail to a web site instead of using SMTP)
 8. SPARQL update to a personal space??

== Future enhancements:
 1. Search!!!!
 2. Statistics -- vis:: protovis (django-mailman-graph)
 3. Threaded browsing, exhibit...
 4. Invites + Weighted Admission (lists that can only grow by multiple trust chains).
 5. Possibility of replying to posts from web interface
 6. Integrate with Wiki --> this list has this wiki, this wiki can be edited by people in this list.
 7. Spam consideration moderation bits, etc... http://www.mail-archive.com/mailman-developers%40python.org/msg11900.html
== How?
 * What is "Web Mail"?  http://lists.foaf-project.org/pipermail/foaf-protocols/2010-September/003509.html: http://esw.w3.org/Pingback, http://ods.openlinksw.com/wiki/ODS/OdsMail, http://www.prescod.net/rest/restmail/, http://restmail.org/, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/RDF_in_Fifty_Words_or_Less
- django-mailman -- http://wiki.list.org/display/DEV/Web+Interface+Status Ya era hora! (no existia hece 4 meses)
- http://www.mail-archive.com/mailman-developers%40python.org/msg11851.html
- django-foafssl (https://rhizomatik.net/myceliafoafssl/)-- we only have to polish the authentication

== TODO
- read about mailman architecture
- learn about mailman plugin system

- JS Libraries: Closure (goog) UI ?? Jquery??
